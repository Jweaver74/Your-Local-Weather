## Why I made this site
I put together this site to show what we have learned up to this point in the bootcamp. Showing off HTML, CSS, JS along with many other 
details to build a user and informational site for the end user.



## What I learned
Inserting API's into JS can help the end user pull information from one site instead of bouncing around from site to site looking.



## Challenges 
Getting the Open weather API to integrate into js was the biggest challenge.  My understanding of the concept is still very new 
and very challenging for me to complete. Using Copilot to insert some the code to hopefully receive a working 5 day forecast.
